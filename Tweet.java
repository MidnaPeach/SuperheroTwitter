	/**
	 * The tweet class will make “Tweet” objects. 
	 * The tweet class will consist of three different data values. 
	 * Each tweet object will contain a message body that is 180 characters in length. 
	 * This message will be stored as a string. 
	 * The message string will be parsed by the 
	 *   program for any username that is preceded by an @ symbol. 
	 *   (for example @david would show the tweet on david's timeline) 
	 * You are not limited to tagging only one user in your tweet, 
	 *   however everything must still fit within the 180 character limit. 
	 * The tweet will also keep track of whether or not the specific 
	 *   tweet is public.
	 * The tweet is aware of it's author.
